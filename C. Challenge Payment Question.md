## <p align="center"> C. Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

### Steps:

1. Create a new empty table ```customer_payments``` based on the provided example. 

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_payments;
CREATE TABLE customer_payments (
	payment_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
	customer_id INT NOT NULL,
	plan_id INT NOT NULL,
	plan_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	payment_date DATE NOT NULL,
	amount NUMERIC (5,2) NOT NULL,
	payment_order INT NOT NULL);
````

2. Create a new supporting table ```n_month``` containing the numbers 1 to 12 (to represent the 12 months of the year).

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS n_month;
CREATE TABLE n_month (
  n INT
);

INSERT INTO n_month
    (n)
VALUES
    (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(12);
````

3. Create a common table expresion (CTE) with several transformations of existing tables and insert this data into the ```customer_payments``` table.

    - Create the temporary table contains a history of plans and plan changes for each customer using the ```STRING_AGG()``` function.
    - Create the temporary table with the history is split into rows for each plan, maintaining the order of plans, using the ```CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT()``` function.
    - Add information about the previous plan, the start date of the previous plan, the next plan and current plan, using the ```SUBSTRING()``` function multiple times.
    - Add information about any reduced price if the customer upgraded their plan during an active billing period, using the ```CASE``` AND ```DATEADD()``` functions.
    - Add the date of the last payment for the current plan, using the ```DATEADD()``` functions.
    - Split data into rows corresponding to recurring payments using the ```n_month``` table.
    - In last step calcutale the reduced price only for the first payment in the subscription and filter out any duplicate payments from old and new plans.

### Final thoughts

To improve the database, we need to make some changes:

1. In the ```subscriptions``` table, add the ```subscription_id``` column as a primary key.
2. In the ```customer_payments``` table, add the ```subscription_id``` column as a foreign key to link the ```subscriptions``` and ```customer_payments``` tables. Delete the ```plan_id``` and ```plan_name``` columns, as they are duplicates of existing information.
