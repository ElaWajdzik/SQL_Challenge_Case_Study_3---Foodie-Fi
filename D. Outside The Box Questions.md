## <p align="center"> D. Outside The Box Questions

The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

### 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

#### Startegia A - The rate of growth based on number of customers 

In the dataset, the data mostly comes from 2020, which is why the best way to calculate the growth rate is to use monthly periods. This parameters is also useful to monitor over different time periods (e.g. weekly, quarterly, yearly). If we take a longer spread of time, this parameter will better show the long-term trends.
<br><br>
$$
Growth Rate = \frac{Customers\_Current\_month - Customers\_Previous\_month}{Customers\_Previous\_month}  x  100
$$

Based on the calculated data on the number of new customers and new paying customers, aggregated by each month (SQL code below), I have prepared visualizations of the Growth Rate. The growth rate shows significant fluctuations from month to month. Overall, it tends to hover around 0%. If Foodie-Fi wants to grow, they should focus more on outbound campaigns and implement more marketing strategies to build a larger customer base and establish a strong, healthy business.

````sql
WITH all_customers AS (
	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		MIN(start_date) AS start_date
	FROM subscriptions
	GROUP BY customer_id),

new_customers AS (
	SELECT 
		DATETRUNC(month, start_date) AS start_date,
		COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS new_customers
	FROM all_customers
	GROUP BY DATETRUNC(month, start_date)),

all_paying_customers AS (
	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		MIN(start_date) AS start_date
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id IN (1,2,3)
	GROUP BY customer_id),

new_paying_customers AS (
	SELECT 
		DATETRUNC(month, start_date) AS start_date,
		COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) As new_paying_customers
	FROM all_paying_customers
	GROUP BY DATETRUNC(month, start_date))

SELECT 
	nc.start_date AS month_date,
	nc.new_customers,
	pc.new_paying_customers
FROM new_customers nc
LEFT JOIN new_paying_customers pc
ON pc.start_date = nc.start_date;

#### Startegia B - The rate of growth based on revenue 
<br><br>
$$
Growth Rate = \frac{Revenue\_Current\_month - Revenue\_Previous\_month}{Revenue\_Previous\_month} x 100
$$
<br><br>
As in **strategi A** I calculated the growth rate is to use monthly periods. Based on the data in the ```customer_payments```  table, I aggregated the revenue by each month (SQL code below). I have prepared visualizations of the Growth Rate. The growth rate shows a significant decline at the end of the year. The revenue grew from the beginning of 2020 but slowed down in the second half of the year. To provide a complete picture, I also added a chart showing the revenue value for each month.

Another approach to measuring growth would be to calculate the rate of growth based on profit, but in this dataset, we don't have data on costs.


````sql
SELECT 
	DATETRUNC(month, payment_date) AS month_date,
	SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM customer_payments
GROUP BY DATETRUNC(month, payment_date)
ORDER BY DATETRUNC(month, payment_date);
