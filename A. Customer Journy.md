## <p align="center"> A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the ```subscriptions``` table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!


````sql
-- generate a random list of 8 unique customer IDs.

WITH customers AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
	FROM subscriptions)

SELECT 
	TOP 8 * 
FROM customers
ORDER BY NEWID();
````

````sql
-- check how customers changed their plans over time based on popularity

WITH plans_in_time AS (
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	STRING_AGG (plan_id, ',') AS plan_list -- concatenate the information about all plans for each customer in chronological order (by start_date)
FROM subscriptions
GROUP BY customer_id
)

SELECT 
	plan_list,
	COUNT(*) AS customer_number
FROM plans_in_time
GROUP BY plan_list
ORDER BY customer_number DESC;
````

### Subscription Rules:
- The trial lasts 7 days.
- After the trial, the customer automatically continue with the Pro Monthly plan.
- If the customer churns, the subscription will end after the current payment period.
- If the customer upgrades from the Basic to the Pro plan, the higher plan begins immediately.
- If the customer downgrades, the plan change will take effect after the current payment period ends.
